# RealTimePlantClassification
This model is designed to classify amongst 30 different species of plants in real-time using a webcam. The core architecture of the model is based on the ResNet-18 deep convolutional neural network, which has been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on a custom dataset of labeled plant images.
